# DBOT_Public
A personal project created for fun, DBOT (short for "Dalle Bot") started as a way for my friends to use DALL-E 2 in our small Discord server when it was novel. Over 9-12 months, it grew into a versatile bot with features like TTS, music playback, and AI-driven tools, evolving through periodic updates whenever I found the time.
