# DBOT: A Versatile Discord Bot for AI and Multimedia Integration
DBOT, originally short for "Dalle Bot," began in April of 2023 as a fun personal project hosted on Replit to enable DALL-E 2 usage in a small Discord server when the technology was still novel. Over time, it evolved into a powerful and versatile bot, eventually being migrated to a Raspberry Pi for more robust and dedicated hosting. Continually expanding through updates over approximately a year, DBOT now integrates AI, multimedia tools, and custom Discord features.

This repository, DBOT_Public, is a sanitized version of the original project, with all sensitive information, API keys, and non-essential merge/pull request history removed for security and simplicity.

## Features
- #### Image Generation and Manipulation:
Leverages AI tools like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E for creating and editing images based on text prompts or uploaded content.

- #### Text-to-Speech (TTS):
Offers text-to-speech functionality with custom voice options using APIs like ElevenLabs and FakeYou, bringing dynamic interactions to voice channels.

- #### Music Playback:
Streams music directly into Discord voice channels from sources like YouTube and Spotify playlists.

- #### AI-Powered Conversations:
Includes OpenAI-powered conversational capabilities for fun and engaging interactions in chat.

- #### Custom Discord UI Elements:
Implements buttons, dropdowns, and other interactive components for streamlined bot interactions.

- #### Server-Side Features:
Handles data securely with MongoDB, manages message history, and logs interactions for enhanced functionality.

## Why DBOT?
What started as a small experiment to integrate cutting-edge AI tools into Discord has transformed into a multipurpose bot designed to enhance server engagement. DBOT is a fun, evolving project reflecting my interests in programming, AI, and building tools that bring people together.

## Technical Highlights
- Built with Python, utilizing discord.py for seamless server integration.
- Features asynchronous task handling for efficient operation.
